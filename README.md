# printf() project
## Description:
   The printf function is used to display a formatted character string.
The first parameter of this function represents the formatting character string:
the format.
#
	It can be followed by one or more parameters which will be the data used
during the display.
#
	Using the printf () function: the format of the printf function is as
below: $string = 'recreate printf()';
#
	printf ("project to %s", $string);
#
	/* Display "project to recreate printf()" */
#
	the "project to % s" character string corresponds to the format and
specifies that a character string (% s) will be replaced at this place.
#
	In the formatting sequences, in addition to % s, we can find:
#
	% c will display the ASCII value of a number % d will display an integer
	% i will display an integer point value
	% d will display a decimal value in binary
	% s will display a sum of decimal or char value

#
	we will try to recreate in this project the printf () function and fill
in with the majority of its options and arguments in order to display them
